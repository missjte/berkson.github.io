When I was younger, I spent a lot of time on 4chan for, uhh... various reasons (porn), but sometimes good things popped up every now and then that got me thinking.  Today was the first time that I'd visited the site in a few years, and the first thread that I opened actually had something pretty cool in it! **A writing prompt**!  The subject was *Slavery Worldbuilding*, and was a little bit rough, but I wanted to share it with you, my friends, to maybe be inspired a bit like I've been!

<hr>

**How would you set up this simulation?**

You have been selected to be an early member of a space colonization effort.  You choose to accept.  You will be put into cryogenic sleep for the duration of the journey, which will likely take thousands of years in which you will not age.  However, during the transit, your consciousness will be transported to a full-dive VR simulation to intellectually stimulate you however you desire.

This simulation looks and feels completely real.  You are given a few scenarios to play around with.  The primary one that we care about here, since we're preverts, is a fantasy-based lewd scenario.  It is a fantasy world with magic, monsters, and otherworldly scenery.

There are two character states: Free mode & slave mode.  These come into play in-game. You can maintain multiple "files", though again with some limitations.  "Saves" have no backups and can only resume from the latest save point per character. There is an option to play without sexual content enabled, but we don't care about that.

AIs populate the world - you are not connected to other "players".  They are, however, indisginguishable from real life and fully capable of every conceivable emotion, and due to their connection to the singularity controlling the simulation, far beyond that as well.  You can not tell that they are not real.

When you start the game, you get the option to create your character, which has all the options you would expect.  The game simulates the sensation of having the body you chose.

**You also get to pick certain options about the world:**

1) You can also turn off player enslavement, meaning you don't have to worry about being enslaved yourself if that's not your thing.
    * You can start free but leave the option to be enslaved when defeated in combat.
    * You can even start as a slave.

2) In free mode, you can log out and switch characters freely. *However*, in slave mode, certain game features are disabled:
    * "*Waiting*" to skip time is disabled.
        * You must participate in the world in real time.
        * You cannot log out.
            * Now, not being able to log out sounds scary, but there is a safety: you can emergency abort.  This has a cost (that you are made aware of after turning on player enslavement), and your character is deleted permanently.  You lose everything from that character that you've earned.
        * All world options are locked. This means that whatever you chose earlier is what you are stuck with.
    * The dominant is fully simulated, and s/he will use you as s/he pleases in accordance with world options.

**Some examples of things that the world options could include:**

3) Who can be enslaved?
    * Are slaves male-only?
    * Female-only?
    * Can both genders be enslaved?
        * Can only a specific gender be masters?
        * Which races can be enslaved?

4) What kinds of clothing do people wear?
    * You can specify specific types of clothing by gender and by status. (*For example*: you can have all men dress skimpily, or you can specify certain outfits to be used for slaves that are different from those of freepersons.

5) How are slaves used?
    * Are they made to participate in physical labor?
    * Sexual use?
    * Both?

6) How are slaves treated?
    * Are they kept bound a certain way?
    * Are specific devices used?
    * Are specific forms of sex *preferred* for slaves?
    * Are specific forms of sex *not* used for slaves?

7) How is escape handled?
    * Are you free once you manage to get away? Or is there a bounty system, such that when escaped bounty hunters will chase you down to deliver you back to your rightful state?

8) Options that affect slaves will affect both players **and** AIs?

**And of course, whatever else you imagine.**

**How do you build your character? What options do you pick for the world? Be creative!**

I'm totally going to write about this, I love it... and I hope that a few of you, dear readers, will join me in making their versions of this!

If you do decide to join me, I ask that you don't feel completely limited by the options here:  It was clearly written from the viewpoint of a submissive, as it focuses mostly on submissives and their worlds, but if you are a dominant please feel free to change it in any way that you feel fit to better suit your ideal simulation!

So, when I have a bit more time in the next few weeks, I might have a rough outline done, following the format of this prompt!  And, who knows, maybe after that I'll follow the outline and write a story, too! =)
