Didn't feel too hot while we were at home, so I wanted to work out.  Berkson was less than excited but I made him take his pre-workout and go anyways.

I guess it's true, at least from me, that you're always one workout away from a better mood... I'm **much** happier now that I finished, and at the same time I got the opportunity to do part of Berkson's workout was well.

He was excited to include me and walked me through proper form for all three of my exercises and even did his **Overhead Press** together with me (while we were facing each other! **CUTE!**), all while being encouraging and sweet.
