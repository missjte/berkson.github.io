Hi everybody it's eiren and I thought I'd give you my happy femdom story on how i met Berkson...

We met on a game called secondlife, something that I've been playing for around 10 years now.

I was a virtual escort, well, I guess I can say I kind of still am... I login to play with some of my older clients.. which, if you're curious on how that works, second life [has it's own economy and currency (called Lindens) which can be earned through the game, or sold and bought for other currencys at the going exchange rate, that is used to purchase goods and objects on second life].  It's kind of like the sims, only better.

So... when I was doing this game, I was actually working my way through college and needed the money really badly.  I learned really quickly that I had the gift of gab, and men were willing to pay me to essentially talk or type dirty at them and there was a large market for men that wanted to get off to a dirty hot avatar who wouldn't complain about their fantasies and had no limits.  It was a really easy way for me to make money.

Anyways, I'm going to tell you about how I met him:

I had a mutual friend with my ex in this game who co-owned a full-prim sim.  If you don't know a whole lot about Second Life, you're not missing much, but to be short a sim was a place where you could visit and do various things, like shop, place objects, or build... among other things.  Owners generally shared land or rented it out because of the huge monthly costs.

Well, through our friend, my ex was actually given a piece of this land
