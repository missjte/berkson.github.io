**Stationary bike** for **25 minutes**.<br>

**Treadmill** for 25 minutes; walked for **20 minutes** and jogged **&frac38;^th^** of a mile for the remaining **5 minutes**.

Really tired, not much of a mood change tonight... today wasn't a bad day, just "*meh*," you know?  Wasn't really a bad day, we just sat around and hung out for a little while and watched Netflix.

Knee's been hurting me lately, but Berkson wanted me to go to the gym anyways since he feels that I might benefit from additional exercise with my knees...

Also, I miscommunicated with him about what ***I*** wanted to do and what I wanted ***him*** to do at the gym, so he ended up lifting again.

Oh well he'll get over it.
