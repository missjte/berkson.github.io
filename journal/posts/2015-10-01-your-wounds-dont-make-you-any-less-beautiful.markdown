For those of you who follow me on Twitter, I think I've made it pretty clear Eiren has had a very hard life...

Sometimes our bodies fight against us.  Eiren has had more than her fair share of misery in her life because of it, but for the first time in her life she's been able to take back control. Exercise has helped, and so have many hard surgeries... but the thing that has helped the most, I think, was my support...

She had never had someone in her life genuinely care about her well being, and... with all of the humility I can muster, I am proud to say that I absolutely do.

Eiren had another major surgery last week, and has had nothing but bad thoughts about how she looks... although I see her as beautiful, sometimes it takes another little nudge from something else to remind us that our brains aren't always on our side.

**My Mistress, my love...**

**Your wound's don't make you any less beautiful...**
