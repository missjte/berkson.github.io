I'm sorry for what I'm about to do, I really am, but I need you to do something for me:  I need you to remember one of those things that you think about before you fall asleep at night.

I need you to think about that one thing or another that you did that makes you go "Ugh!  This is over, this happened years ago, go away.  I'm over it!"

Maybe it was embarrassing.  Maybe it was sad.  Maybe it lost you a job or a friend or a lover.

Maybe it hurts.

It still hurts.

It happened years ago and it hurts you to even think about.  You're over it, but you'll never *truly* be over it, right?  Before you go to bed... while you're driving... someone saying something that takes you back... this is something that you're going to die trying to forget but you know that it just isn't going to go away, even if the feeling isn't anguish, it's annoyance.

It's "Why?" and "Fuck this." and so much "Just leave me alone." right?

I know how you feel.

I really, *really* know how you feel.

Everything I just wrote about is how I feel.  It happens when I'm dreaming, it happens when I'm alone, it happens when I pass certain restaurants... it just isn't something that is ever going to go away no matter how much I might want it to.  My brain re-runs all of it, all of the conversations, all of the interactions again and again, trying to come up with a new solution to the problem... but there isn't a solution to this one.

This was a lesson painfully learned that I'll remember for the rest of my life and no amount of new experience is going to make this particular one any less horrible for me to think about.

It sucks... but life goes on, and even if it consumes my thoughts at seemingly the most inopportune times... it certainly doesn't and won't consume my life.

This is the story about the worst mistake I've ever made.

A story that makes me think back before it ever happened.  If I had been more like my parents, for example, this experience could have easily cost me my marriage

A story that makes me look to the future and plan.  It makes me want to be more successful and it gives me drive to succeed in things that I would have otherwise never cared about.

A story that ruins me.
