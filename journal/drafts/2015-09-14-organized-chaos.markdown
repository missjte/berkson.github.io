# Updates

I haven't had any real updates on here or Twitter since _Eiren_ left to Texas... the last month and a half has really been rough and exciting and busy on both of us, and everything else had to sit on the back burner's back burner for a while.

She was only gone for a little over a week, but it was a lot harder on me than I anticipated.  A **lot** harder.  When she got back, I was super possessive and clingy.  I took time off of work for the week, almost as if I was trying to get back the time I lost when she was gone.  It was honestly kind of scary, because I've never been like that.  My job has required me, multiple times, to be gone from her weeks or months on end... but it's always been me having to go somewhere, and her staying safe at home... safe and protected.  When she went somewhere else, for the first time in eight years... somewhere that I didn't know if she would be taken care of... it freaked me out.  Was she okay?  Are the people she is with being nice to her?  Is she going to panic if something goes wrong, and how will I get to her as quickly as possible if something does happen?

Well, thankfully, everything was going smooth after I adequately loved and squeezed and hugged and bit her enough, until... Surprises at work.

**I got promoted, guys!**  Only two of the people who read me know how **truly** significant that is, but in any case all it's really boiling down to is... more money & more responsibility.  The past few weeks I've been receiving extra training to help me fill a more supervisory role at work, on top of the things that I'm already doing which will stay the same.  It's all quite exciting, but it is also little nerve wrecking.  All in all, it's been very busy.

Related slightly to work, I've also begun learning Japanese, starting with Hiragana, one of four alphabets, which is a hugely different language than English in nearly every sense... so far.

And to top the rest of this off... we _both_ have been sick, and I had been in and out of the Emergency Room, until I was finally able to make an appointment with my primary care physician, who gave me some pretty good stuff to take care of it.

Eiren got much better **way** before me for the _first time_ in our relationship together, and she has been taking extremely good care of me... although, she has threatened to take me to the _vet_ if the medicine my PCM gave me doesn't start kicking my ass... I'm still pretty damn sick.

# Progress Report

I've been keeping track of my workouts in a pocketbook that I carry on me at work since the middle of August.  Weightlifting has been out of the question since I don't have a rack right now, so I've been logging **all** the push-ups and sit-ups I do throughout the day, which is a **lot** more than I thought I did before I started writing them all down, and we just got a new Gym membership with a pool, so instead of running I've been swimming!

Our new gym is much more expensive than the one at work (free), but they also have a 24 Hour pool and spa, both inside and outside, and this allows Eiren & I to swim... which gives her the tools to rebuild all of the muscle that she's lost over the years.

It's a really great thing for the both of us, and it is one of the only actual workout that she is able to do without hurting herself.

That, by itself, is enough to make me happy.
