Blog
====

This is the source code for [my personal site][prickyourfinger]. It is a static site
generated by a simple generator written in Haskell by [Ruud van Asseldonk][rudda].

It is encouraged to view the original authors Github for software information and support.

This is version two of my blog. Previously, I used [Hakyll][hakyll] (available
in the `archived-hakyll` branch).

Compiling
---------
Build the generator, then build the site (requires fonts to be present):

    $ stack build
    $ stack exec blog

Or compile with good old Cabal:

    $ cabal update
    $ cabal sandbox init
    $ cabal install -j
    $ cabal run
