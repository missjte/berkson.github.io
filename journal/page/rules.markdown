**Expectations, Rules, and Commands** and what they mean to us are all explained in our [Mantra].

## Current Expectations

1.  We will always love and remain faithful to each other.
2.  We will always respect our limits and safewords to their absolute fullest.
    *   We will work past soft limits over time, and hard limits if requested **and** discussed at length.
    *   We will have a safeword for **_physical distress_** and a safeword for **_emotional distress_**.

### Eiren's Expectations

1.  Berkson will always tell me the full truth.
2.  Berkson will, environment permitting, refer to me as Mistress.
    *   Ma'am is a suitable alternative in public.
    *   He is not expected to refer to me with an honorific in the presence of our families or work.

### Berkson's Expectations

1.  Mistress Eiren will always tell me the full truth outside of play.
    *   _Play_ in this scenario denotes a scene, or a surprise (such as a present), and in other words means that she may lie to me **only** under those two circumstances.
        *   Example of a **permissible half-truth**: Mistress Eiren tells me that she will allow me to orgasm at the end of a scene, but refrains from mentioning that she plans to ruin it.
        *   Example of a **permissible lie**: Mistress Eiren tells me that she has nothing planned for my Birthday, when in reality she has bought us both tickets to see _Wicked_.

## Current Rules

1.  Berkson must satisfy Mistress Eiren before himself, and must think about her pleasure before his at all times.
2.  Berkson may not speak back or out of turn without permission.
3.  Berkson may not sit on the furniture without permission.
    *   His computer chair and the shoe stool are exceptions, unless he exhibits bad behaviour or abuses this privilege, in which case it will be taken away.


## Current Command (Extra Nerd Points: **sudo** to run as a superuser.)

1.  **Snap of the Fingers**
    *   Berkson will stop talking, close his mouth, and pay attention to Mistress Eiren.
2.  **Heel**
    *   Berkson will immediately prostrate himself.  His nose will touch the ground, feet and hands will rest flat
