# Warning

I'm no one special, and I don't have this fantastic life where my Mistress & I share in an almost otherworldly exchange of power.  I'm just some guy who blogs badly and writes worse, trying to give you some insight in a relationship that is, a lot of the time, rocky, scary, depressing, and sad.

Throughout all of this, my dearest hope is that most of all that you who come to read this that may be in a similar situation understand that this isn't an end all, be all guide to submitting under these circumstances.  I'm not a doctor, I'm not educated, I'm just Eiren's, and to speak on behalf of our relationship is the only qualification I possess.

# Prelude

I don't really know what I'm doing with my life, because _I'm_ not the person that I _really_ want to be, but I'm _with_ the person I was _meant_ to be with.  I'm with someone who, like me, is confused about what she wants to do with the rest of her life.

Unlike me, however, she started off never having a chance.

I was born into money and, through my own choices, am in debt that I'll have to work _myself_ out of.  I am healthy, and strong, and although I don't know where I'm going, I've always known that I have the ability to make something for or of myself.

She was born into poverty and through the choices of those people around her who should have provided her with a future and security of health, they pushed and dragged her down a hole of ineptitude, bigotry, and suffering.

The hurt and hell that she had to go through to get here was awful, and it's painful to think about, but looking at her frustrated because she doesn't know what she's going to do, just like me, makes me so happy... your life wasn't lost, and everything that has happened in your past doesn't have to determine your future.

So, without further adieu, I present to _you (the very few)_, my long overdue review of us two... **What it's like to be submissive to someone with ongoing and severe disabilities.**

# Shit's hard, yo.

Most of my blogging, to me, feels like I'm always complaining... and it's one of the things I hate about myself.  Why can't I write about happy things?  Why is it that I am always having problems, or something is always going wrong.

The truth is, I really don't know.  I don't know why I'm not more upbeat and with it, and I wish I was.  I wish I could tell you how happy life is, and how easy life is being for me.  How the good things that happen to me come easily and without unintended problems of their own, and how the bad things go quickly and don't have a lasting impact.

Unfortunately, that's just not the card I was dealt.

I support someone who's body & mind are, for all intents and purposes, broken.

I support someone who isn't capable of holding down a job largely due to her anxiety and agoraphobia, and isn't capable of receiving benefits from the government due to having never worked and thus not being eligible for public assistance.

I support someone who has special diet restrictions that are largely expensive on top of the debt that we've both accumulated for being immature and irresponsible.

I support someone who, on nearly a daily basis, thinks about suicide and how much easier it would be for me if she just killed herself.

Someone who, before she met me, was just waiting around to die.

# On being a fixer and giving space.

If I were to tell you that her life was a mess before I actually moved in with her, I'd be grossly understating the situation.

At the same time, though, if I were to tell you that she was completely willing to change her life around when I started trying to make changes, I'd be a fucking liar.

Eiren didn't want to hear me tell her that she had to quit smoking, for example. It was obvious to me that she had breathing problems and heart issues without ever needing to see the doctor.
