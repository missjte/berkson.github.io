**Spin class** for **60 minutes**.

I'm a lot stronger than when I first started the class, I'm able to stand up a lot longer... feeling really confident with the class.  It's my 8th time ever going and I see my stamina increasing a LOT.

**Tire flips** for **15 minutes**, maybe **16 flips** total.

I was tired before the tire flips but I felt *ruined* after doing the tire flips, really tired me out after so much cardio.

<hr>

Little more tired than I thought I'd be by the end of the workout, I didn't expect to do flips but the boy asked me if I wanted to do something with him so I eagerly accepted.  Happy to finish and get the chance to workout with him.

Speaking of which, since he's writing down everything I say right now verbatim... if he doesn't **offer** to log for me after **my** workouts, he's going to find himself with a **lot** less computer and twitter time until his priorities are straightened out.

You can procrastinate all you want with your logs, but you **will not** procrastinate with mine.

Bad boy. *\*tsk tsk\**
