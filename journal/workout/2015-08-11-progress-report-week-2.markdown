## Prelude
The platform on which I build this site, Hakyll, generates static HTML files locally, which I then commit & push via Git to my private server when I'm (mostly) satisfied.  I generated this post a few days ago, excluding this part, but I never pushed it. **Sorry about that!**

### Wednesday
HIIT & Jog day.  I attended a work sponsored fitness program after my shift ended that I didn't bring my phone to, so I don't have numbers or remember the workouts I did.  I'd say that it's safe to say that I ran somewhere near 3 miles over 45 minutes.

### Thursday
I had a little bit of time at work to take off and go to the gym, but not enough time to finish the full workout.  In addition to that, a few people from work joined me and thought they'd be helpful by interrupting me mid-set to comment on my form.  I had been doing a closer grip bench press to work my triceps more since I feel they're not as strong as I'd like them to be, but they grabbed the weight **in the middle of my fourth set** to say that I should be doing it wider grip to work my chest more.

**Really, you don't say?**  Well, it threw me off for the next set after that because I was a bit pissed and I ended up failing my five reps for the 5th set, and I didn't count the full of the fourth since I _had_ to perform a tiny bit of yelling induced cardio at my _esteemed_ coworkers.  Don't talk to me while I'm working out.

_Don't touch my fucking weights mid-set. **I will fucking end you**_.

### Friday
Mistress left early in the morning, and I went to the DMV after seeing her off at the Airport, picked up a stranger off the side of the road and gave him a ride down the street, then went home and slept.  When I woke back up I had some lunch, then a few hours later did four supersets of 50 push-ups, 30 sit-ups, 2 minutes of jumping jacks, 1 minute planks, and 30 roman twists.  I wasn't really the happiest camper on Friday without Mistress and spent a lot of the day moping and complaining on Twitter, which if you read my tweets at all, is probably pretty annoying.  I apologize for that.

## Final Thoughts
The week was mostly good, besides for a **few** rage-filled moments.  There was always the looming "She's leaving this week. PANIC IMMEDIATELY." thoughts in the back of my head, but I was alright and had a pretty good week overall.  Something important to me was that I actually _felt_ more submissive than usual, which is nice, because when I _don't_ feel submissive I feel like I'm letting her and myself down, and silly as it sounds.  We talked a lot about how our relationship has been progressing positively, and how even when we're being negative toward each other it has been handled in a positive way.  That's a HUGE improvement.
