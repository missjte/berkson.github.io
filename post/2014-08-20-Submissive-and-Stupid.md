**My name is Berkson**, and I struggle, and have struggled with writing for the last ten years of my life

I've made countless websites, wrote hundreds of rough drafts, sought and given advice on numerous forums, mail groups, blogs, comment systems, text messages, and even games... and I still struggle making myself write... something that I love to do, but honestly, *that isn't my only problem*.

It has taken me most of my adult life and the most wonderful women on the planet to understand that my problem isn't just writing... **it is everything**.

I lack the motivation to do a lot of things in my life, from working out, to educating myself, to even bettering my relationship.

This is my attempt to hold myself accountable, to encompass everything in my life that I hold near and dear to me and take responsibility for the things that I can change, starting with my servility and writing.

### What do I know about myself & what am I willing to admit to myself?

1.  I am a**(n awful)** submissive
      * I am horrendously inexperienced
      * Disobedience is second nature.
2.  I'm in my early twenties, but have been married all of my adult life.
3.  I am married to **Eiren**, a dominant and sinfully amazing woman who has overcome more in her 35 years of existence than most people will ever dream of in a lifetime.
      * My absolute desire in life is to be better (at everything that I am and am not) for her.
4.  I love to write, but hate sitting around and writing.
5.  I love to run, but hate spending the time alone with my thoughts.
6.  I spent the better part of my childhood skipping school.
7.  I'm productive when physically at work.
      * I lose all interest when I return home from work.
        * Unless I am actively engaged in a project or given an assignment by Eiren.
          * I don't actively ask Eiren for assignments or instruction.
8.  I don't read as much as I used to growing up.
9.  I say “No.” to Eiren depending on my mood and how I feel about what she asks of me.
      * I emotionally drop every time I say “No.”, but don't apologize or ask for another chance.
10.  I am not vain, judgmental, or egotistical.
      * I am a selfish lover.
      * I can be quite rude.
11.  I am fairly decent with all things electronic.
12.  I thoroughly enjoy margaritas.

...And many more fallacies, as well as the occasional strength, to come.

I had planned to write some romanticized depiction of who I was, how my life is, and the problems I have in the world of submission, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

I don't have a *bad life*, but I feel like I'm a *bad person*.

I'm not the person I *want to be*, but I'm with the person I *was meant to be with*.

Honestly... **I just want to be her good boy.**
