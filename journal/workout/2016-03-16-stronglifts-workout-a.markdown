Sort of annoyed that I haven't had better progress, but that's really my own fault since I've had so much trepidation lately...

Even after lowering the weight by 20lbs I've been having slight lower back pain during the majority of my Workout, so it's probably for the best that I haven't had much progress.  Makes me think that I probably need a belt.

But yeah, still annoyed.  Starting next week, any workouts will be 100% limited to walking for at least six weeks... **maybe** sooner if the doctor clears me for anything else.

Feel like I'm going to have to totally destroy my workouts this week and into Monday evening to compensate, my surgery being Tuesday morning.

**Transcribed note from Mistress Eiren:** Yeah, fuck you. Forget what I said about "you can procrastinate on your own time" on my log.

I just watched you make this and it really wasn't that much work.  You want computer time? You want Twitter time?  Do your *chore* first.
