Tried to go as fast as possible today & with the exception of benching, I only took 1.5 minute breaks between sets.

I wasn't really in the mood to think a whole lot so I didn't bother coming up with my own warm-ups, I just followed the program. *The whole program*, I didn't realize that I happened to be squatting more than the 45lbs like I usually do until I was in my third set and by then I really didn't mind.

By the time I got to planks, though, I was told that they'd be closing the outside enclosure (where I normally workout at my gym) for the night... Too lazy to finish the other two sets of planks. One is good enough, *right?*

Honestly, I was really hoping that I could run around the track right outside of the enclosure a few times after my workout, but by then I had just been kicked out, it was dark, and Mistress was more than ready to go, so we just up and left.

All in all, a good workout night.
