title: Who Are We?
published: August 11, 2014

**Eiren** is a dominant in her thirties, **Berkson** is a submissive in his twenties.  This is our journey to make it more than just that, because right now... that's all it is.

**Eiren** is dominant, but isn't always **Berkson**'s dominant.

**Berkson** is submissive, but isn't always **Eiren**'s submissive.

We have been married for six years and are madly in love with each other, but we recognize that we both wan't more... and we recognize that it may take a lot of time for us to reach our goal.

For us, we have a lifetime of learning, teaching, and getting to know each other... and although relationship is built on bonds stronger than us just being dominant or submissive... we know that we'll find what we've always wanted with each other if we push past our current boundaries.

## More About Us & Reflections:
As time goes on and the more effort we place in to actively changing our relationship together, we hope that we can look on here and see who we are or who we were at any point in our journey, and as such, everything - including edits - will be saved as an archive.

At points in our journey, posts written about ourselves will be chosen and tagged as our **reflections**, these will be used to help us better gauge where we both are at, in our own words.

## PrickYourFinger.org?
The name **Prick Your Finger** does not make much sense or have any context in reference to our relationship to anyone other than us, but ultimately the name is based on and in honour of Disney's original [Sleeping Beauty]'s **Maleficent**, the ***Mistress of All Evil***.
