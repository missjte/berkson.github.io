**HIIT Class** for **60 minutes**.

It's a lot of burpees, heavy breathing... Up & Downs? Things with steps could be a better description I guess.  Hard on the knees, and due to how heavy I am it's hard for me to do the class at the same speed as everybody else, but I do my best... I might be slow, **but I never give up**.

Proud of myself, very, VERY exhausted & sore.  Pretty much every day I go to workout, I don't have a great day until my workout is finished.  I never, ever feel accomplished or happy unless I work out or Berkson takes care of me... so the same was true for today.  I haven't been having a very good few weeks due to a lack of progress on the scale...
