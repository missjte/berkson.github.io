Workout was fine, got the chance to perform without shoes for the entire thing, from start to finish.

Mistress joined right after I finished my second set of squats after her warm-up in the main gym, and she was struggling with her workout a little so I couched her through it.  Made me feel good.

During the workout I was actually pretty happy, I usually am **while** I'm working out, but I'm just kind of apathetic today.  Nothing bad going on, but I guess my mind is wandering too much for my own good.
