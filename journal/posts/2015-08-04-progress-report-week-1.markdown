### Prelude & Notes (not workout related)

I re-edited my original post to remove posting to Fitocracy weekly.  The change is available for review here: [`1340873`](https://github.com/berkson/berkson.github.io/commit/1340873#diff-cfbb24185b59afd9e34c7394a5a11223L42)

The reason for the change was I felt that, due to what I'm actually doing and the program which I am following, I don't really use Fitocracy or the Fitocracy app for tracking my workout.  I end up transcribing what I've already written down in one app to another, and it's just going to set me up for failure when I fail to accomplish it.

Indeed, [Ferns](http://twitter.com/Ferns__)^[If you don't already follow her (which would surprise me), please checkout her blog [Domme-Chronicles](http://www.domme-chronicles.com)!] puts it excellently and over-promising is corrosive to a relationship.  If I want to focus on fixing obligations, I feel that I should make sure that I can actually do it and recognize that I may have either obligated too much.  _I will say that I already post a sceenshot from my phone after every workout_ in <samp>#fwocrew</samp>, which I feel accomplishes mostly the same thing.

For the sake of transparency, all of my posts are tracked via Git.  This allows you to see any changes I may have made to a post - I'm not trying to hide anything or trick anyone, and it's all changes are available to the side of the post in the [`Archive`](/archive/) to the right side in the fashion of: [`sha`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) [`history`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History)

### The actual reason for the post (workout related)

> **Weight:** 210lbs (93kg) — **BMI:** 30% — **Diet:** Maintenance

I worked out three times last week.  Given that it was my birthday last Wednesday, and that I hadn't made the post until Monday evening, I feel that **for this time only** it was acceptable to not hit four days.

Tuesday | Friday       | Saturday
--------|--------------|----------
HIIT    | Powerlifting | Jog & Run

#### Tuesday

The gym was closed and I don't yet feel safe to use my own weights in my garage without a squat rack, so I had to substitute power lifting for a HIIT day.  I spend 25 minutes on the Exercise bike, followed a 10 minute ab circuit video on YouTube and 50 pushups total to close it off.

#### Friday

Plainly, I just didn't want to be there.

Squat  | Bench Press | Barbell Row
-------|-------------|------------
95x5x5 | 105x5x5     | 70x3x5

I didn't want to completely start over with just the empty bar on squats, but I did cut back quite a bit.  My PR for Squats is about 140 right now, which isn't very much, but I don't want to hurt myself.

Bench Press was  pretty straight forward and I felt pretty good about myself after doing them, nothing to really note here.

Then there are Barbell Rows... I hate Barbell Rows.  I feel like I'm too tall for it at 6’ 7” and I hate it.  So, I just didn't do 5x5 on them and did 3x5 instead.  This doesn't really bother me because I hate the exercise but I realize that it's essential.  I'll probably _try_ for 5x5 the next time I do them, but no promises.

#### Saturday

I jogged and walked a total of 2.22 miles over 44 minutes and 22 seconds.  I began by jogging, but due to the DOMS from not lifting in quite a while I couldn't keep it up and walked for 20 minutes.  I didn't really enjoy this, because I didn't have anything to think about that wasn't going to stress me out.  I tend to overthink things and if I can't come up with solutions for problems I already have, I go back on things that I've already figured out and learned from.  It wasn't conducive, so I started running again once I couldn't deal with the bullshit I was thinking about and ignored my legs feeling week.

### Final Thoughts

The week was great, it was my birthday and I've accumulated a few days of paid leave so I took them.  I don't really like the format I had for this post, so while I likely won't edit the content, I will likely change how future posts and how they're formatted.
