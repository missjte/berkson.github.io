> "I don't want to work out today..." — **Me**, _every single day ever_.

Introspection is such a strange thing; it's easy to know your problems but, at least for me, they're so hard to work on.

To be fair, I've actually come a good long way in the past year.  My relationship with Mistress Eiren is stronger than it's ever been and for the first time in my entire life, I've actually had a _stint_^[Longer than three months!] of time where I was working out, just for me, regularly and on schedule, **with** obvious progression... and that did more for me than any other single physical change I've ever had in my entire life.

I slept better, I dream't better, I loved better.  I had a **personal** routine, something that I was damned proud of doing... but most importantly, **I stuck to an obligation until I couldn't, even when I didn't want to**.

I hate that I struggle with obligations so much, especially because I have a relationship that is built on top of obligations, especially because, when I don't follow through with my obligations, I'm just being a liar, and especially because it doesn't hurt just me, it hurts the person who all I want to do is cherish.  It hurts someone who, by all accounts, owns me.

Who has taken it upon herself to say that I am _her lover_, _her friend_, _her husband_, _her slave_... with the expectation that I will be adult enough to do the things I say I will do.  She gives me the gift of ownership and I repay her with garbage, half-baked half-truths.

That is so much worse than if I were to have just never made the obligation at all.  Don't get me wrong, I say "no" a lot, but we have our reasons for that... they're not always good reasons, but we've agreed that they are in a lot of ways legitimate (to a very specific point); but not following through with something I say I'm going to do is by any account horrible.

If I tell you I'm going to do something, I should do it.  If I promise to do something, and I don't follow up or accomplish my tasking, I am hurting you.  I am lying to you.  I am throwing away whatever trust, measly or great, you put into me — that you gifted me, because I'm a fucking flake.^[Relevant: ["When your submissive says 'No'"](http://www.domme-chronicles.com/2011/11/when-your-submissive-says-no/) via [Domme-Chronicles](http://www.domme-chronicles.com/) by [Ferns](http://www.twitter.com/Ferns__)]

### So how do I fix myself?

For my development as a person, I can't keep doing this to myself, I can't keep doing this to **her**.  I'm not the person I want to be, and although Mistress Eiren is a powerful force in my life, it's unfair to expect her to be the force of change on something that she have ought to deserve in the first place.

**I** have to be a force of change in my life, and this is a bad habit **I** have to break.  That isn't to say that she can't or that she doesn't help me, or encourage me, but if I can't do this for her, what right do I have to call her my owner, my Mistress?  What am I giving back to the relationship?  _Why am I even kidding myself with saying that I'm submissive?_

So, I'll start with something familiar, something that I'm used to... working out, every week, at least three times a week.

### Emotional & Physical Fitness

The cool thing about this is that I'm literally "working out my problems" and the solution makes me, in my mind, a better submissive all around.  I personally believe that one of the best things someone who describes themselves as submissive can do is have a good body and take care of themselves.

This doesn't nessessarily mean be ripped, but living a healthy lifestyle and taking care of a body that you ultimately want to surrender.  **I'm all about that life**.  Just because I don't workout like I was or log like I did when I was on my _routine_ doesn't mean I haven't been working out, because I do every morning before bed and every evening when I wake up (weird schedule, don't judge me).

To top all of this off... when I work out, Mistress Eiren wants to work out too.  For those of you who actually read what I write (one, maybe two of you?) you might have guessed that she has suffered from _pretty severe_ medical issues her entire life.  If I hadn't met her... she **probably would** have been dead.  I changed her life around pretty dramatically, to include bringing an other-than-sedentary lifestyle into our relationship.  Working out together is so special to me, because it's a testament to how far **she** has come and how much we've grown together.

### The Plan

I'll workout, at a minimum, four days a week.  Two days for strength training and two days for cardio.  Making sure I do at least two of either these is great, because it makes me want to shoot for five days.  Three days of running or three days of lifting is ideal, so it motivates me to schedule out more days to accommodate my goal.

I must log my workouts on Fitocracy, to include my morning and evening routine, as well as an end-of-the-week update on here.  I'll post my stats (not including height) weekly:

> **Height:** 6’ 7” (201cm) — **Weight:** 200lbs (91kg) — **BMI:** 30% — **Diet:** Maintenance

As well as a consolidation of everything that I've done during the week, how I felt emotionally and physically, and my goals for the next week.

### In conclusion...

Flakiness sucks.  I need to remember that this isn't just for me, but for **Her**.  For the people that I tell I'm going to do, so I can be trusted.  So I can be someone worth trusting.

That means so much to me.  No one can fix it but me, and I have to do it.  I have to be able to self-improve, to constantly look at myself and think how I can do better, and then ask her if I'm right or if I'm wrong... We're a team, and I've been a shitty teammate.

I will do better.
