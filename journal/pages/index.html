        <strong>Eiren</strong> &amp; <strong>Berkson</strong> are a married dominant and submissive couple in a female led relationship, exploring life and total power exchange, together.</br>

        </br>We have a lifetime of learning from each other ahead of us, and although our relationship is built on bonds stronger than us just being dominant or submissive, we're excited for the opportunity to live in service of each other every day.</br>

        </br>The name <strong><em>Prick Your Finger</em></strong> is inspired by and in honour of <strong>Maleficent</strong>, the <strong><em>Mistress of All Evil</em></strong>, from Disneyâ€™s original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_(1959_film)">Sleeping Beauty</a>.  The words are special to us and the relationship we share together.
