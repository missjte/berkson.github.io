        <p><strong>Eiren</strong> &amp; <strong>Berkson</strong> are a married dominant and submissive couple in a female led relationship, exploring life and total power exchange, together.</p>
        <p>We have a lifetime of learning from each other ahead of us, and although our relationship is built on bonds stronger than us just being dominant or submissive, we're excited for the opportunity to live in service of each other every day.</p>
        <h3 id="more-about-us-reflections">More About Us &amp; Reflections:</h2>
        <p>As time goes on and the more effort we place in to actively changing our relationship together, we hope that we can look on here and see who we are or who we were at any point in our journey, and as such, everything - including edits - will be saved as an archive.</p>
        <p>At points in our journey, posts written about ourselves will be chosen and tagged as our <strong>reflections</strong>, these will be used to help us better gauge where we both are at, in our own words.</p>

        <p>The name <strong>Prick Your Finger</strong> does not make much sense or have any context in reference to our relationship to anyone other than us, but ultimately the name is based on and in honour of Disney’s original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_(1959_film)">Sleeping Beauty</a>’s <strong>Maleficent</strong>, the<wbr> <strong><em>Mistress of All Evil</em></strong>.</p>
