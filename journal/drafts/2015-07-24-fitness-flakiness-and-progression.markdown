Like most people, I make excuses for a lot of things that I don't want to do.

> My arm hurts, I can't exercise today!

Go for a walk.

> My legs hurt, I can't walk either!

Do some stretching.

> I don't want to exercise today!

Well fuck why didn't you just say that to begin with, **stop whining.  Exercise anyways.**
