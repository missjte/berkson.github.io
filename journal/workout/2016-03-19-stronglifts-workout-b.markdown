Back hurting much, much more today. Kind of bitter, but it'll be fine... I won't be doing StrongLifts for **six and one half weeks** starting today, and won't be doing any strenuous activity for **six weeks** starting on **Tuesday**, which is my surgery date.

Overall I'm satisfied I guess, although I definitely could have done better if I would have had a belt.
