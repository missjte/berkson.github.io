The mask has been with her all of her life, she was born with it, and it has always been there for her to hide behind when she needed protection, when she needed space, and when she needed to be alone.

And when she was alone, she'd take it off and sit down at her desk, happy and fearless, to view another world of anonymity and safety... her Second Life, the internet, the games, another universe...

Because for her, it was just another mask and it was comfortable and she was sure that there was no real difference between the one on her face, and the one on the net.  She was safe behind a blackened screen where no one would ever see her.  _But that isn't quite true._

You can hide your face, and you can hide your body.  You can pretend, and you can lie, and you can run.

**But if you let someone into your life, you can not always hide your soul.**

And so the second mask slowly faded until it was gone and forgotten, and she was left with only the mask she was born with.  When she finally let me visit her, she was certain that the mask was full and dark and black and safe.  She was sure that it covered everything precious, because she was ashamed of who she was, terrified that if she took it off, I'd be able to see her for what she saw in herself.

**Oh, my wonderful lover... she never realized that I could always see right through it, and all I saw was beauty...**
