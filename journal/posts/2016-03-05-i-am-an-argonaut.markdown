You know, it's funny. There are stories about people, authors, or artists who stumble upon inspiration and suddenly a story has to follow it.

An artist draws a picture and words speak from his character.<br>
An author makes a supporting character and they come to life.<br>
A group of boys who hear tales of adventure and become heroes.<br>

I heard a word in a show a couple months ago, and the word spoke to me in quite a literal way, a "This is who I and what I am." sort of thing.  A revelation of sorts, even.

I am an [argonaut](http://theargonauts.com/about/what-is-an-argonaut.shtml).

First and before everything else in my life, I'm an adventurer and I've always been one.  Through every aspect of my life, I've been on a quest of some sort:

**Find the girl.** (*Meet Eiren.*)<br>
**Win the heart of a Queen!** (*Fall in love with each other.*)<br>
**Seek the treasure.** (*Make bad decisions.*)<br>
**Cleanse the castle.** (*Fix some of the bad decisions. ~~Whoops.~~*)<br>
**Save the Queen.** (*Find a way to save Eiren's life...*)<br><br>
**Visit the dungeon...** (*Ahem...*)<br>

And it's so fitting to me to say that, and it feels so right that I can't help but to feel attached to the word.  I can't help but listen to what it's telling me sit and pay attention, because there have been people before me who can teach me, and there will be people after me who I'll teach.

Adventurers make mistakes all the damn time.  They stumble and they fail and they die.  More often than not, they're really not heroes of any sort... but sometimes they do small things here and there for the greater good... and sometimes not.  They become the villain, and die miserably.

But at the end of the day, they're just people.  What the word really, truly says to me is: "You're only human" and because of this, **each and every single one of us is an adventurer.**

Not everyones adventure turns into an epic and history has taught us that... So, really, I'm no one special at all.

**I'm just the boy who wanted to save the Queen.**

I'll tell my ever-growing story and not many people will look at it twice and think: "What an adventurous life!" but I think that's probably for the best.  I'll live through the struggle and overcome the challenges that await every day life the best that I can.  I'll learn from parents, teachers, friends, enemies and, of course, my Queen.

Sometimes I'll just sit and relax, too.  I'll reflect on my story and look for lessons that I may have missed when I first experienced it.

**Life** is an adventure, we all know this... but I don't think all of us know that we're the adventurers.
