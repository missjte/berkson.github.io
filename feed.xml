    <summary>And this is a huge part of our lives.  Perhaps even the largest.  I make the big decisions, I have the big responsibility, and I'm held accountable for all of it from her.

Relationships are a fluid, changing environment.  What works for some people will never work for others and vice-versa.</summary>

    <summary>My most important function in our relationship isn't my ability for compassion, it isn't my trying to wake up a little earlier each day to bring her coffee, and it especially isn't my ability to make her happy.  It's my ability to say "No, Eiren."</summary>
